# FNV1A Hash Library (C++)
By Joseph Juma

## Version
0.1.0

## About
This single-header library provides an implement of the FNV1A
(Fowler Noll Vo alternate algorithm) hash function. This is a
non-cryptographic hash function with reasonable, but imperfect, collision
resistance. It's fast to compute, and can be implemented for compile-time
execution, lending it multiple advantages over other hash functions.
